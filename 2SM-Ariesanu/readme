The course with Camelia Ariesanu, the seminary with her or Emanuel Cismas. I recomment the seminary with Cismas, as it is easier to get better grades and he's more understanding :)

The seminary will consist of 2 tests: 
*the first one from counting techniques, discrete random variables
*the second one from pairs of random variables, differential equations.

The exam will consist of 2 parts (and you need to get at both parts >=4.5 in order to pass):
*the first one from counting techniques, discrete and continuous random variables, pairs of discrete random variables (also you'll have a midterm from the first part)
*the second one from pairs of continuous random variables and differential equations
