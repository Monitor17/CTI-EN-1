The course is very useful, not only for the exam, but for the lab, as well. Prof. Todinca explains quite well if you pay attention to his courses.

4 tests at the lab:
*First one from Karnaugh Maps and minimization (quite easy to get almost 10)
*Second one from Decoders, Multiplexers etc. (at this one you need to study more but not so hard, still - a lot of people could fail)
*Third one from latches and flip-flops (you need to f-ing memorise the truth tables, diagrams etc.)
*Fourth one from clocked synchronous state machines (which is not so bad, but you need to study and pay attention to the lab and course)

# Reminder
You can re-take all the tests, but only once in W14 and the highest grade remains :)
Also, be active in the lab (by solving exercises at the whiteboard), as you can get bonus 0.25 pts for each lab you are active (those points, after applied to the lab grade, can be transferred to the exam grade: i.e. if you have 1.25 bonus and you have 9.50 at the lab, you can use 0.75 at the exam).
