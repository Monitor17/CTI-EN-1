The course is very useful, not only for the exam, but also for the lab. Prof. Todinca explains very well and he's quite an understanding teacher. 
Maybe he'll give some points for course presence, but that's not for sure.

For the lab, you'll have 4 tests and you'll receive extra points for activity during the lab (like solving exercises on the whiteboard):
*Test 1 - Karnaugh Maps and Minimization (This one is the easiest, you just need to pay attention at the lab)
*Test 2 - Decoders and Multiplexers, combinational circuits (For this one we needed to study more, but it wasn't so hard if you went throughout the course)
*Test 3 - Latches and Flip-flops (This one was the worst one, you'll need to memorise all the latches and flip-flops and the truth tables and diagrams)
*Test 4 - Clocked synchronous state-machines (I don't remember many details from this one, but it wasn't so hard)
Also, don't try to cheat during the tests, because the tests are for a very short time and you need to write a lot :)
