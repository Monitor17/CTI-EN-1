The lab and the course were both with Marllene Daneti, also called "Buni" :) I think this is the easiest subject from the first year. 
Go to the course, as she will give you 1.4 points bonus at the exam.

There will be 2 or 3 quizes at the lab (and all of them are on CV, you can take them with your phone, so you can search all of the info you want).
Also, you'll need to write summary and conclusions and what you needed to do at the lab (which will be graded), and present in the last weeks (I think W13 or W14), but don't worry, 
you just need to give her the papers and she'll correct them.

For the exam part you have a lot of materials from which you can solve. She doesn't drastically change the subjects and it's really easy to solve them, if you study before.
