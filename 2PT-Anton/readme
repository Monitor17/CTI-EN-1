The course with Alin Anton. He can give you a "10" at the course for actively and correctly answering some questions during the course. The course and the lab are strongly tied together.

The lab with Anton (is quite easy, you can receive a 10 easily if you solve the problems, which are not really hard and he can help you if you ask), 
or Razvan Cioarga (you won't do pretty much at the lab, he doesn't really care, but you'll learn more next year at DSA :/ )
or Cosmin Vlaicu (I have no idea who he is so I don't know)

I won't post the labs as they are on CV, but the exam will consist of 2 problems (and both need to be graded >=5 in order to pass the exam) from the topics in the "Topics.jpg" file. 
Approximately (probbably only if you have the exam with Anton) the problems from the files here will be the same at the exam 
(maybe we don't have all of them, but prof. Anton will prezent them during the course as well).

I've also posted the exams from CTI-RO (the Series that have the course with Iapa). I think they will be pretty useful as they are similar with what you'll receive at the exam.
