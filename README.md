# CTI-EN-1
This is only for the first year subjects :)

You also have here the link to previous years (which will be useful later as well): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qaWTnBLObPOBUcfR8vNgNEOV26zKKIz7?direction=a

For CAM, I don't have anything from our year and I don't think you'll need anything as the exam is open-book and the labs are really easy (also, there is nobody I know that actually failed this subject).
